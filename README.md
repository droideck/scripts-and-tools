# Hey there, welcome to Scripts and Tools! 👋

So, you've stumbled upon my mixed bag of scripts and tools written in Python (and some other lauages I'll add later). Here you'll find all sorts of useful (hopefully) stuff that I've cooked up to make life a little bit easier.

## What's inside this treasure chest? 📦

Well, here's how I've arranged everything (for now, it's only Python but I have plans):

- **python**: This is where the Python stuff lives.
- **bash**: Here be Bash scripts.
- **rust**: Rusty tools are parked here.

Within these directories, you'll find more subdirectories. Each one is a home for a separate script or tool, along with its own README file that gives you the lowdown on what it does and how to use it. If any script or tool has tests, they're chilling out in a `/test` subdirectory.

## Ready to dive in? 🏊

First off, clone this repository with this magic spell:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:droideck/scripts-and-tools.git
```

Then, just wander into the directory of the language you're interested in and follow the breadcrumbs (a.k.a instructions) in the individual README files.

## Need help? 🆘

Just shout (or rather, open an issue). I'll do my best to lend a hand.
